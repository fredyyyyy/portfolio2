                        <h1>Amilcar Cabral Portfolio</h1>
                        <h4>Introduction:</h4>
                        <p>Welcome to the portfolio dedicated to Amilcar Cabral, a visionary leader, revolutionary
                            thinker, and prominent figure in the fight against colonialism and imperialism in Africa.
                            This portfolio provides an insightful look into Cabral's life, his pivotal role in the
                            liberation movements, and enduring impact on the struggle for African independence.</p>
                        <h4>Early Life and Education:</h4>
                        <p>Amilcar Cabral was born on September 12, 1924, in Bafat√°, Guinea-Bissau, a Portuguese colony.
                            His early years were marked by a deep commitment to education, leading him to study agronomy
                            and agricultural engineering in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
                        <h4>Founding the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC):</h4>
                        <p>In 1956, Cabral co-founded the PAIGC, an organization dedicated to the liberation of
                            Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde from Portuguese colonial rule. His leadership and intellectual
                            prowess played a crucial role in shaping the party's ideology and strategies.</p>
                        <h4>Philosophy of Armed Struggle:</h4>
                        <p>Cabral advocated for the strategic use of armed struggle and guerrilla warfare as a means to
                            achieve independence. His influential work, "The Weapon of Theory," emphasized the
                            importance of consciousness and cultural identity in the struggle against colonialism.</p>
                        <h4>Guerrilla Warfare and Independence:</h4>
                        <p>Under Cabral's leadership, the PAIGC conducted successful guerrilla warfare against
                            Portuguese forces, ultimately leading to the proclamation of independence for Guinea-Bissau
                            on September 24, 1973, just months before Cabral's assassination.</p>
